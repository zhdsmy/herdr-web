# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Declared the existing Herdr logo as the browser favicon.
  [PR #56](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/56), contributed by
  [Craig P. Motlin (@motlin)](https://github.com/motlin).

### Changed

- Redesigned the Herdr Web and PWA icon with system-aware white-on-black and black-on-white variants.
- Applied the Animal Island UI visual system across the entire Web app, including workspace,
  terminal, notes, settings, dialogs, menus, feedback, safe areas, and mobile controls.
- Changed UI typography to the theme-bundled Nunito and Noto Sans SC fonts, added self-hosted Noto
  Sans Mono for monospaced surfaces, and moved terminals to a warm light palette.
- Refined the workspace chrome with denser segmented controls, grouped list cells, a quieter hierarchy selection, and compact mobile terminal actions.
- Joined the compact Tab bar to the surrounding teal mobile chrome while retaining distinct active
  and inactive Tab treatments.

- Preserved the iOS and iPadOS safe-area and keyboard geometry while replacing the previous
  iOS-inspired visual layer with the Animal Island theme.
- Simplified Web-only delivery to a focused check followed by direct incremental asset deployment
  without creating deployment backups.

### Fixed

- Served cache-busted 1024 px iOS home-screen icons instead of upscaling the 180 px preview asset.
- Matched Safari's top browser chrome to the compact Herdr header without changing the bottom chrome.
- Removed the compact tab-strip divider, reset touch-sticky refresh highlights, and improved spacing
  around Bridge fields and agent sections.
- Kept compact Settings tabs, content, and actions inside a safe rounded scrolling panel, and made
  the horizontally scrollable mobile terminal key strip end with a visual fade instead of a hard
  clipped key.
- Prevented saved Bridge rows from clipping the Add bridge action on compact Settings, kept the
  disabled terminal stage action legible, and adapted Codex's fixed dark prompt surface to the warm
  light terminal palette.

- Fixed browser layouts overlapping top and bottom safe areas without duplicating Android system
  bar insets, and matched the browser top safe area to the app header.
- Refit mobile terminals as the visual viewport changes and settles, including iOS and iPadOS
  software-keyboard transitions.
- Fixed intermittent iOS and iPadOS keyboard gaps and extended mobile surface backgrounds through
  the bottom safe area without covering controls.
- Added explicit revalidation for Web entrypoints while keeping hashed assets immutable, preventing
  installed iOS Web Apps from reusing stale pages after deployment.

- Fixed icons rendering slightly off-center in square icon buttons (sidebar section header
  actions and the tab bar's new-tab button) by resetting the user-agent button padding, and
  removed the per-icon transform that compensated for it.
  [PR #55](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/55), contributed by
  [Philippe SEGATORI (@tigitz)](https://github.com/tigitz).

### Removed

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-05

### Breaking Changes

- Herdr `v0.8.0` or newer with terminal protocol exactly `19` is now required. The bridge rejects
  the previous protocol `17` baseline and other unreviewed protocols instead of attempting a
  backward-compatible wire fallback. [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)

### Added

- Added a contextual Move Space mode to the Spaces menu. The selected space card becomes draggable,
  retains a cancel control and arrow/Home/End keyboard support, mutes unrelated sidebar actions
  until the move is completed or canceled, and moves worktree groups atomically within their host's
  canonical workspace order. [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)
- Added persistent expand/collapse controls to grouped Agents, Tabs, and Spaces headers, including
  independent, visually nested host and workspace controls for Host + workspace grouping and a
  bulk expand/collapse control for the current Agents or Tabs list.
  [PR #47](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/47)
- Added a default-off Display setting that combines same-named workspaces across hosts when using
  Workspace grouping, while retaining host context on each agent or pane row.
  [PR #47](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/47)

### Changed

- Refreshed the minimal vendored Herdr compatibility sources to the `v0.8.0`/protocol `19`
  baseline, including the current API schemas, terminal wire definitions, and input model shims.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)
- Follow Herdr's canonical workspace order when atomic worktree groups are reordered.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)
- Simplified Workspace grouping in the Agents and Tabs sidebars to show workspace-only group
  headers and move host context into each detail row. Host + workspace grouping keeps its nested
  host and workspace headers. [PR #47](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/47)

### Fixed

- Fixed built-in agent launches against Herdr `v0.8.0` by waiting for a newly created pane's shell
  to become available before starting the managed agent.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-30

### Breaking Changes

- Herdr `v0.7.5` or newer with terminal protocol exactly `17` is now required. The bridge rejects
  older protocol `16` daemons and unreviewed newer protocols rather than attempting a
  backward-compatible wire fallback. [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Removed the obsolete `custom_status` field from bridge snapshots and activity events; agent
  presentation now uses Herdr's `state_labels`, title, display-agent, and status fields.
  [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Changed the default ungrouped Tabs and Spaces sidebar presentation to compact rows with inline
  host, Space, and tab context instead of contextual headers. Agent panes in Tabs also use the
  Agents row presentation and agent-aware ordering by default. Choose a grouping mode to restore
  contextual headers, or disable Agent features in Tabs to restore generic pane rows and the
  original tab order. [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)

### Added

- Added a default-on client-local Sync navigation setting. Browser tabs and windows with sync off
  can view different panes through the same bridge without publishing or following shared pane
  selection or changing Herdr's focused tab through ordinary navigation.
  [PR #42](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/42)
- Added default-on Agent features in Tabs, including consistent Agents row metadata and pin
  placement, agent-aware sorting, and pinned-only and active-only filters. Non-agent tabs remain
  visible at the bottom of agent-aware sorts; disabling the setting restores generic pane rows.
  [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)
- Added multi-host Spaces controls: Spaces can be shown as a flat list with host context or grouped
  under host headers, and the default-on Multi-host Space selection setting can be disabled to limit
  Space-scoped Agents, Tabs, and Notes to one globally selected Space. All scope remains unchanged.
  [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)

### Changed

- Refreshed the minimal vendored Herdr compatibility sources to the `v0.7.5`/protocol `17` baseline,
  including the current API schemas and terminal wire definitions.
  [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Updated launching for Herdr `v0.7.5`: built-in agents use the managed `agent.start` flow after the
  destination pane is created. The bridge waits for interactive readiness and rolls back its new
  tab or pane after rejection, early process exit, or timeout. Custom launcher presets continue to
  execute their exact configured `argv`. [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Store the Sync navigation setting browser-wide while keeping sync-off pane selections only in
  memory. The app no longer creates per-tab navigation storage records.
  [PR #43](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/43)
- Simplified agent-row metadata by removing generic status text already communicated by the status
  indicator and badge, while retaining bridge-defined state labels.
  [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)

### Fixed

- Cleared and remounted the mobile terminal command field after Send or Stage so stale native input
  cannot prefix the next command. [PR #44](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/44), with an
  earlier implementation contributed by
  [Alexander Makarov (@AlexanderMakarov)](https://github.com/AlexanderMakarov) in
  [PR #38](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/38).
- Fixed client-local navigation synchronization across reloads, reconnects, lagging snapshots, and
  rapid multi-client selection races. Sync-off split navigation now stays local, and independent
  clients no longer rewrite shared navigation persistence. After a bridge restart, the focused
  Herdr pane now seeds shared navigation so synced clients immediately converge.
  [PR #43](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/43)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added Grok and OpenCode agent icons in the Agents sidebar and create-menu launch choices.
  [PR #36](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/36)
- Added built-in launcher presets for Grok and OpenCode (`builtin:grok`, `builtin:opencode`).
  [PR #36](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/36)
- Added optional `builtins` allowlist/order in `launcher-presets.json` so the create menu can show a
  subset of built-ins without PATH probing. Omitting `builtins` keeps the full default set; `[]`
  hides all built-ins (custom presets still appear). Short names (`shell`) and full ids
  (`builtin:shell`) are accepted; unknown entries warn and are ignored.
  [PR #36](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/36)

### Fixed

- Kept the first selected character anchored during mobile endpoint dragging, aligned the loupe caret
  with the selected row, and centered a hollow drag handle over the anchored character.
  [PR #35](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/35)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-07

### Breaking Changes

- Users must upgrade Herdr to `v0.7.2` or newer before upgrading herdr-web. The bridge now requires
  a Herdr daemon with protocol `16` because browser snapshots use Herdr's native
  `session.snapshot` API.
  [PR #32](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/32)

### Added

- Added an Agents-view active-status filter that shows only agents currently
  marked working, blocked, or done, with grouped views hiding empty groups after
  filtering. [PR #31](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/31)

### Changed

- Refreshed the vendored Herdr compatibility baseline to `v0.7.2`, including protocol `16`, native
  session snapshots, layout/scroll event schema drift, and terminal observe/control wire messages.
  [PR #32](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/32)
- Changed `/api/snapshot` to use one native Herdr `session.snapshot` request instead of separate
  workspace, tab, pane, and per-tab layout requests.
  [PR #32](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/32)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Added bridge-owned configurable launcher presets for the create menu, including argv-based custom
  agent commands, optional Herdr agent hints, and horizontally scrollable launch choices.
  [PR #30](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/30)
- Documented macOS x86_64 desktop tarball support alongside Linux x86_64 and macOS ARM64 release
  artifacts.
  [PR #30](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/30)
- Refreshed the vendored Herdr compatibility baseline to `v0.7.1` for launcher preset agent hints.
  [PR #30](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/30)

### Fixed

- Fixed mobile sidebar space selection so tapping a space updates the scoped Tabs list instead of
  snapping back to tabs from the previously selected pane.
  [PR #29](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/29)
- Fixed a bridge reattach race where a client reconnecting right after the last viewer left a
  terminal could be rejected by the daemon with `already has an attached client` and shown a
  permanent `Attached elsewhere` error; the bridge now shuts detached attach connections down and
  reattaches only after the pending detach has been delivered.
  [PR #26](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/26)
- Stopped detached terminal attach connections from leaking a blocked reader thread and an open
  socket on both the bridge and daemon sides after every pane switch.
  [PR #26](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/26)
- Serialized concurrent first attaches per terminal in the bridge and made the web client briefly
  retry `already has an attached client` rejections, so multiple viewers reconnecting at once
  (for example after a bridge restart) no longer strand a terminal on a permanent
  `Attached elsewhere` error. The bridge also now logs daemon-initiated attach connection closes,
  which were previously recorded nowhere.
  [PR #26](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/26)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added an `Add note` action to pane and agent sidebar context menus, opening a quick-create
  dialog with a focused title and optional body that attaches the new note to the target pane.
  [PR #24](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/24)
- Added Mobile settings for an expanding terminal command input and Enter-as-newline
  editing, allowing long prompts to wrap and remain viewable while preserving send-on-Enter
  by default. [PR #21](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/21)
- Added bridge-tracked agent status transition activity with an Agents view sort option for
  `Last status change`, using semantic status changes rather than terminal output activity.
  [PR #23](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/23)
- Added server-side agent pins with pinned-first agent ordering, a pinned-only sidebar toggle, and
  a selected-pane header toggle plus a small pinned indicator on pinned agent rows.
  [PR #22](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/22)
- Added bridge-owned pane notes with a sidebar Notes view, desktop/mobile notes editor, pane
  attachment recovery states, and per-bridge note synchronization. Notes are exposed through the
  same bridge request policy as terminal controls, so allowed bridge clients can read and mutate
  saved note content. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Added a Notes feature toggle plus persisted desktop notes panel sizing, notes list collapse
  state, notes panel open state, pane note tabs, and a dedicated Other notes list.
  [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Added a Markdown preview mode for notes that remembers Edit/Preview preference locally and keeps
  the Markdown renderer lazy-loaded until preview is used. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)

### Changed

- Unified the `session_key` reported by `/api/agent-activity` with the notes and agent-pins
  endpoints (`session:default` and FNV-1a socket hashes instead of a divergent local format).
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Extended the pinned-only sidebar toggle to the Tabs view so pinned panes can be found outside the
  Agents view. [PR #23](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/23)
- Notes created from the notes panel now open in Edit mode with the title selected, so the default
  title can be replaced immediately. [PR #24](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/24)

### Fixed

- Made the bridge close and cleanly reattach terminal sockets that fall behind fast output instead
  of silently dropping frames and corrupting the rendered stream.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Moved the bridge's remaining blocking daemon round-trips (snapshot, selection, agent activity,
  rename-label lookups) off async worker threads, so a stalled daemon no longer freezes unrelated
  requests and terminal websockets.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Bounded the bridge's per-terminal input queue so a client sending faster than the pty drains no
  longer grows bridge memory without limit.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Fixed terminal session races where a client connecting while the previous one disconnected could
  be handed an already-detached session, and where the daemon handshake blocked all other terminal
  clients.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Stopped the bridge from silently tightening permissions on a pre-existing operator-supplied
  `--upload-dir`; only directories the bridge creates itself are set to 0700.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Applied the standard 120-byte label validation to `pane.rename` requests, matching every other
  rename/create command.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Stopped a cancelled terminal mount from leaking an orphaned renderer and duplicated canvas when
  the pane changes while the terminal module is still loading.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Made single-cell touch selections highlight correctly instead of silently storing a wrong
  scrollback row.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Preserved combining characters and multi-codepoint emoji when copying terminal text via touch
  selection.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Kept the selected note open while no pane is selected, so notes no longer deselect mid-edit when
  a bridge disconnects, has zero panes, or a notes refresh lands.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Made Escape in settings number fields discard the typed value instead of committing it, and stop
  it from closing the whole settings dialog; out-of-range numbers now snap back to the clamped
  value in the field.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Reordered Android hardware-back handling so open menus and dialogs close before the notes panel
  underneath them.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Made Escape cancel the rename dialog from any focused control, not just the text input.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Extended long-press text-selection prevention to the stage header pane title.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Restored the intended drop shadow and muted URL color on the terminal selection sheet, which
  referenced undefined CSS variables.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Validated agent-pins responses at the fetch boundary so a malformed bridge response degrades
  gracefully instead of crashing the sidebar render.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Prevented sidebar row labels and terminal tab labels from being text-selected during long-press
  context-menu gestures. [PR #24](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/24)
- Fixed notes editor selection and autosave edge cases so switching to panes without notes clears
  the editor, deleting the selected note no longer shows a deleted note, and stale local save
  refreshes do not appear as external note changes. Also fixed mobile delete-dialog back handling
  and unresolved note recovery actions in the notes panel. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- On mobile, kept the note editor's terminal action available for the current pane and made it
  close the full-screen notes surface. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Changed mobile notes back navigation so back closes the notes surface from the editor, while a
  separate header button shows the notes list. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Kept the new-tab button pinned at the right edge of the top tab bar while the tab list scrolls.
  [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Improved terminal reconnect/resume handling so Android foregrounding and quick terminal switches
  keep the renderer stable, avoid stale tab flashes, and suppress transient connecting overlays.
  [PR #19](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/19)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Added a Terminal font size setting. [PR #16](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/16)
- Added desktop click-to-open support for detected HTTP(S) terminal URLs.
  [PR #16](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/16)

### Changed

- Added a Mobile setting for long-press behavior, with Off, Copy, and Loupe modes; Loupe uses a
  two-stage endpoint flow, selected URLs keep the action sheet, and tapped HTTP(S) URLs open
  directly; original mobile selection work contributed by Will Hampson.
  [PR #16](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/16)

### Fixed

- Fixed Android/tablet bridge color picker dismissal so saving a backend after choosing a color
  keeps the Settings dialog open. [PR #16](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/16)
- Fixed sidebar keyboard shortcuts so agent and tab navigation follows the visible host/sidebar
  order across selected-host and all-host views. [PR #18](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/18)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Added multi-bridge connections, allowing multiple saved bridges to stay enabled at once with
  server chips and an all-agents sidebar overview. [PR #17](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/17)
- Added a bridge `--allow-connect-origin` option so bridge-served web pages can opt into connecting
  to other trusted bridge origins without relaxing the default Content Security Policy.
  [PR #17](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/17)
- Added a Host + workspace grouping option for agent lists.
  [PR #17](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/17)
- Added configurable bridge colors with a mobile-friendly color picker.
  [PR #17](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/17)

### Changed

- Moved sidebar agent/tab sorting and grouping controls into a vertical options menu, and removed
  redundant host prefixes from grouped tab labels. [PR #17](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/17)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added a bridge-owned agent activity stream so pane status, title, display agent, and custom
  status updates reach connected browsers without waiting for a full snapshot refresh; concepts
  derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork. [PR #11](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/11)
- Added Display settings for top/bottom app padding and mobile terminal controls size.
  [PR #13](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/13)
- Added configurable terminal input transport, with binary payload concepts derived from the
  @roy-levi-amazon fork. [PR #12](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/12)
- Added opt-in terminal input batching controls with a fixed 32-byte flush threshold for slow
  connections. [PR #12](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/12)
- Added a Shift-Tab key to the expanded mobile terminal key panel. [PR #11](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/11)

### Changed

- Coalesced fast terminal output bursts in the bridge before forwarding them to browser clients,
  with a per-client Terminal output batching setting for tuning frame churn during rapid TUI
  redraws; concepts derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork.
  [PR #14](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/14)
- Reworked Settings into Bridge, Terminal, and Mobile areas, with horizontal area tabs on narrow
  screens. [PR #12](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/12)
- Improved browser startup by lazy-loading the terminal renderer with retry after load failures,
  adding installable mobile web app metadata and raster icons, and compressing static
  bridge-served web assets; concepts derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork.
  [PR #10](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/10)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-17

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added a native Android setting, on by default, to blur text inputs and refit the terminal after
  the keyboard closes.
- Added an opt-in mobile terminal long-press selection setting with drag-to-copy selection, selected
  URL actions, and touch hit-testing for Ghostty-detected links.

### Changed

- Changed bridge URL validation so users can save HTTP bridge URLs at any valid host or IP address.

### Fixed

- Forced and reapplied Android dark system bar styling with light status/navigation bar icons.
- Removed duplicate bottom safe-area padding inside the mobile terminal controls.

### Removed

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Initial release.
