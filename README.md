Browser UI for Herdr workspaces and agent panes.

This repository is structured as a standalone app that can be distributed without asking users to
modify their installed Herdr checkout. The bridge builds as `herdr-web-bridge`, a repo-owned
executable that uses vendored Herdr compatibility code because the app needs private Herdr APIs for
terminal attach, terminal resize/scroll/input, workspace snapshots, and event subscriptions.

The goal is to provide a browser-native interface for monitoring and controlling Herdr agents from
desktop and mobile clients. It keeps the terminal experience close to Herdr while adding web-focused
navigation, multi-client viewing, mobile input controls, and synchronized pane selection.

## Highlights

- Shared browser terminal viewing with synchronized pane selection across desktop and mobile.
- Mobile-friendly text input with stage/send actions, configurable tap focus, and extended
  terminal key controls.
- Agent-focused sidebar with styled icons for detected Codex/OpenAI, Claude, Pi, Grok, and OpenCode panes.
- Image and file uploads from the terminal toolbar, paste, or drag/drop, with uploaded paths inserted
  into the active terminal input.
- Context menus for renaming, closing, splitting, and moving panes between tabs or spaces.

The bridge is compiled as a repo-owned executable and run with:

```bash
bridge/target/debug/herdr-web-bridge --static-dir web/dist
```

The top-level scripts hide that detail.

## Requirements

For release tarball users:

- A running Herdr `v0.8.0` or newer daemon/session that reports terminal protocol `19`
- A supported host for the downloaded bridge tarball. Current planned desktop release artifacts are
  Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64, and macOS x86_64.

For source development:

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm
- Rust stable
- A running Herdr `v0.8.0` or newer daemon/session that reports terminal protocol `19`

Android development also needs a JDK and Android SDK. See [docs/android.md](docs/android.md).

## Quick Start From Release

Download the matching desktop tarball from the GitHub release, unpack it, and run the bundled
wrapper:

```bash
tar -xzf herdr-web-vX.Y.Z-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd herdr-web-vX.Y.Z-linux-x86_64
bin/herdr-web
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

The desktop tarball includes the web assets and `herdr-web-bridge`; it does not include Herdr.
Start or attach Herdr `v0.8.0` or newer with terminal protocol `19` separately before running the
bridge.

For Android, install the APK from the same release and add the bridge URL in the Bridge area of
Settings. LAN bridges must allow Android's app origin:

```bash
bin/herdr-web --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4000 --allow-origin http://localhost
```

See [docs/packaging.md](docs/packaging.md) for release artifact layout and
[docs/android.md](docs/android.md) for Android behavior.

## Development Setup

```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix web
```

## Development Build And Test

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

Useful narrower commands:

```bash
npm run lint:web
npm run test:web
npm run build:web
npm run check:web
npm run ship:web
npm run bridge:fmt
npm run bridge:test
npm run bridge:build
npm run android:sync
npm run android:build:debug
scripts/package-tarball.sh vX.Y.Z linux-x86_64
scripts/package-tarball.sh vX.Y.Z macos-arm64
scripts/package-tarball.sh vX.Y.Z macos-x86_64
scripts/check-vendor.sh
```

`npm run ship:web` runs the focused Web checks and deploys `web/dist` to the private target list.
See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the target format and deployment behavior.

The Android app is a Capacitor shell around the bundled `web/dist` assets. It starts disconnected
and uses the Bridge area in Settings to save one or more Herdr bridge URLs. Browser-served builds
still default to the same-origin bridge that served the page. See [docs/android.md](docs/android.md)
for HTTP/cleartext behavior, Android SDK setup, and APK verification notes.

## Settings

Settings are grouped by area:

- Bridge: same-origin and saved bridge profiles, reachability testing, and bridge enablement.
- Features: client feature toggles such as Notes.
- Display: browser-wide navigation synchronization, agent features in Tabs, multi-host Space
  selection, top/bottom app padding, and mobile terminal controls size.
- Terminal: browser-to-bridge terminal input transport and input batching delay.
- Mobile: touch-specific terminal behavior when running on a coarse pointer device.

When viewing all of multiple hosts, use the Spaces list `…` menu to group spaces by host or keep a
flat list with host context in each row. The menu stays hidden in single-host scope.

Multi-host Space selection is enabled by default, retaining one active Space per host in
Space-scoped views. Turn it off under Settings → Display to keep only the selected host's Space,
Agents, Tabs, and Notes in those views. All scope continues to show content from every host.

Terminal input payloads can be sent as JSON or binary WebSocket frames. JSON remains the default;
binary is available for comparing terminal input performance. Terminal input batching is off by
default. When enabled, short input chunks are coalesced for `32`, `64`, `128`, or `256` ms and are
flushed early once the pending UTF-8 input reaches 32 bytes, so paste-like input bypasses the delay.

## Launcher Presets

The create menu is owned by the bridge. By default it shows these built-ins, in order:

`Shell`, `Codex`, `Claude`, `pi`, `Grok`, `OpenCode`.

The bridge can load local launcher presets from:

```text
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/herdr-web/launcher-presets.json
```

Override the path with `--launcher-presets PATH` or `HERDR_WEB_LAUNCHER_PRESETS=PATH`.

Optional `builtins` is an allowlist that chooses which built-ins appear and in what order. Omit it to
show every built-in. Use `[]` to hide all built-ins and keep only custom presets. Entries may be short
names (`shell`) or full ids (`builtin:shell`). Unknown names are ignored with a warning. Bridges that
do not yet understand `builtins` reject the whole file (unknown field); upgrade the bridge before
adding this key.

Example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "builtins": ["shell", "claude", "grok", "opencode"],
  "presets": [
    {
      "id": "codex-gpt5",
      "label": "Codex GPT-5",
      "agent_hint": "codex",
      "argv": ["codex", "--model", "gpt-5"]
    },
    {
      "id": "remote-codex",
      "label": "Remote Codex",
      "agent_hint": "codex",
      "argv": ["ssh", "-t", "host", "cd ~/repo && exec codex --model gpt-5"]
    },
    {
      "id": "team-agent",
      "label": "Team Agent",
      "argv": ["team-agent"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Presets use explicit argv, not multi-step terminal typing. Use `["bash", "-lc", "... && exec codex"]`
when shell sequencing is needed. `agent_hint` injects `HERDR_AGENT=<agent>` for the launched process;
Herdr uses that hint to detect agents behind wrappers, SSH, containers, and VMs.

Built-in agent choices are managed Herdr agents. For a new tab or split, the bridge first creates
the destination pane, then calls Herdr `agent.start` with that pane and the built-in agent kind. It
waits for the agent to become interactive; a rejected launch, early process exit, or startup timeout
closes the tab or pane created for that attempt. Shell creates the destination shell without an
`agent.start` call.

Custom presets are intentionally different: the bridge gives their complete `argv` to Herdr's
layout command unchanged. It does not reinterpret the executable as a managed built-in or prepend
an agent command. This preserves wrappers, SSH commands, containers, and other exact command lines;
`agent_hint` remains optional detection metadata for the launched process.

## Run Locally

Start or attach a normal Herdr `v0.8.0` or newer session with terminal protocol `19` first:

```bash
herdr
```

Build the web app and bridge:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the bridge:

```bash
scripts/run-bridge.sh
```

The launcher uses the installed/stable Herdr socket by default:

```text
~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock
```

This avoids debug builds falling back to Herdr's `herdr-dev` app directory. To target a named or
development Herdr session, either pass `--session NAME` to the bridge or set `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`
explicitly before running the script.

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

For LAN/mobile testing:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=4000 scripts/run-bridge.sh --allow-origin http://localhost
```

Uploads are saved under `HERDR_WEB_UPLOAD_DIR`, `XDG_DATA_HOME/herdr-web/uploads`, or
`~/.local/share/herdr-web/uploads` by default. Override the bridge upload directory with:

```bash
UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/herdr-web-uploads scripts/run-bridge.sh
```

The bridge rejects cross-origin browser requests unless the request origin is explicitly allowed.
The bundled Android app uses `http://localhost`, so LAN Android testing needs
`--allow-origin http://localhost`. Bind to `0.0.0.0` only on trusted networks.

For browser-served multi-bridge setups, configure both directions explicitly:

- On the bridge being called, use `--allow-origin ORIGIN` for the web page origin that may call it.
- On the bridge serving the web page, use `--allow-connect-origin ORIGIN` for each other bridge
  origin that the page may connect to. This expands the served page's Content Security Policy for
  both HTTP and WebSocket bridge traffic.

For example, if the page is opened from `http://host-a:8787` and should connect to
`http://host-b:8787`:

```bash
# host A, serving the web page
HOST=0.0.0.0 scripts/run-bridge.sh --allow-host host-a --allow-connect-origin http://host-b:8787

# host B, serving the backend being called
HOST=0.0.0.0 scripts/run-bridge.sh --allow-host host-b --allow-origin http://host-a:8787
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

These app shortcuts are ignored while dialogs, menus, and normal text inputs are active. They still
work when the terminal's hidden keyboard input has focus. OS-reserved shortcuts such as `Cmd+Tab`,
`Meta+Tab`, or some `Alt+Tab` setups may not reach the browser.

| Action | macOS | Windows/Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select previous/next agent pane | `Cmd/Option+Shift+Up/Down` | `Meta/Alt+Shift+Up/Down` |
| Select previous/next tab in the active space | `Cmd/Option+Shift+Left/Right` | `Meta/Alt+Shift+Left/Right` |
| Focus split left/down/up/right | `Cmd/Option(+Shift)+H/J/K/L` | `Meta/Alt(+Shift)+H/J/K/L` |
| Cycle split next | `Cmd/Option+Tab` | `Meta/Alt+Tab` |
| Cycle split previous | `Cmd/Option+Shift+Tab` | `Meta/Alt+Shift+Tab` |
| Split selected pane down | `Cmd/Option+Shift+V` | `Meta/Alt+Shift+V` |
| Split selected pane right | `Cmd/Option+Shift+-` | `Meta/Alt+Shift+-` |
| Open the new-tab launch modal | `Cmd/Option+Shift+T` | `Meta/Alt+Shift+T` |
| Confirm close for the focused split, or tab when only one split exists | `Cmd/Option+Shift+X` | `Meta/Alt+Shift+X` |

## Runtime Model

The bridge exposes:

- `GET /api/capabilities`: bridge feature flags and allow-listed browser commands
- `GET /api/snapshot`: workspaces, tabs, panes, layouts, and shared web selection
- `POST /api/command`: allow-listed workspace/tab/pane commands
- `POST /api/selection`: bridge-owned selected pane for syncing browser clients
- `GET /api/notes` and `POST /api/notes...`: bridge-owned pane notes
- `GET /api/agent-activity`: bridge-tracked agent status transition activity
- `GET /api/agent-pins` and `POST /api/agent-pins/{pane_id}/pin|unpin`: bridge-owned agent pins
- `POST /api/uploads`: save uploaded files into the configured upload directory
- `GET /ws/activity`: bridge-owned pane activity deltas
- `GET /ws/events`: Herdr structural events
- `GET /ws/ui-events`: bridge-local UI events such as selection changes
- `GET /ws/terminal`: terminal attach stream

Herdr core currently allows only one terminal attach owner per terminal. The bridge works around
that by opening one Herdr terminal attach per `terminal_id` and broadcasting output to all browser
clients viewing that terminal.

Input, scroll, and resize from any browser are forwarded through the shared attach. Sizing is
currently last resize wins. The header's refit button forces the current browser to send a fresh
fit/resize frame.

API and WebSocket requests must use an allowed bridge `Host` header. Browser-originated requests
must also be same-origin with the bridge, an explicitly allowed origin such as Android's
`http://localhost`, or a loopback development proxy origin allowed for Vite. Hostname backends must
be explicitly allowed with `--allow-host HOSTNAME`. This is a DNS-rebinding/CSRF guard, not user
authentication.

Bridge-owned notes are part of that same request policy. Any allowed bridge client can read and
mutate saved note content, including clients connecting over a trusted LAN when the bridge is bound
to a non-loopback interface. Do not store sensitive notes on a bridge exposed to untrusted networks.

Bridge-served pages also send a Content Security Policy. By default, `connect-src` allows only the
serving bridge origin and `data:`. Use `--allow-connect-origin ORIGIN` on the serving bridge when
that page should connect to another bridge; the bridge adds matching HTTP and WebSocket
`connect-src` entries for that origin.

Sync navigation is on by default. Selecting a pane updates `/api/selection`, broadcasts over
`/ws/ui-events`, and other clients with sync enabled switch to the same pane. Clients can turn sync
off in Display settings to keep each open tab's pane selection in that tab's in-memory app state.
The Sync setting is shared by every tab on the same browser origin; no pane selection is stored per
tab. Navigation with sync off still uses the same Herdr session: terminal input, structural
commands, and workspace, tab, and pane changes remain shared.

## Vendoring Strategy

The repository intentionally vendors only the Herdr compatibility pieces the bridge builds against,
not the full upstream Herdr application. This is the practical short-term path because the web app
needs private APIs that are not available from released Herdr:

- internal API client and schema types
- client socket path discovery
- terminal attach protocol messages
- terminal ANSI render encoding
- scroll and resize protocol frames

The shipped bridge is `herdr-web-bridge`, a slim executable owned by this repo. It depends on the
local `vendor/herdr-compat` crate for copied Herdr protocol/schema/client/socket helpers and keeps
bridge HTTP/WebSocket behavior in `bridge/src/web_bridge.rs`. A separate upstream Herdr checkout can
be used for refreshes and drift audits, but a full `vendor/herdr` snapshot is not part of this repo.
The cost is that `vendor/herdr-compat` must be kept compatible with Herdr protocol changes.
The current compatibility baseline is Herdr `v0.8.0` and terminal protocol `19`; the bridge requires
that exact protocol rather than attempting to decode older or newer private wire formats.

See [docs/vendoring.md](docs/vendoring.md) for the refresh process.

See [docs/packaging.md](docs/packaging.md) for desktop tarball and APK artifact packaging.

See [docs/release.md](docs/release.md) for release validation, browser smoke testing, tagging,
GitHub release creation, and manual artifact upload.

## Long-Term Direction

The cleaner upstream shape is for Herdr to expose a supported web bridge or public protocol surface:

- stable snapshot endpoint
- stable command allow-listing
- stable event stream
- terminal attach fanout or multi-client attach
- exact pane focus/selection API
- resize ownership semantics
- browser auth/token support

Once that exists, this repository can drop most or all of `vendor/herdr-compat` and use the public
surface.
